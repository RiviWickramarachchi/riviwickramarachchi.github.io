												This is a mini isometric game that was created as a submission for the Lost Relic Game Jam 2022. Since the theme that
												we got for this game jam was "Connection", our team thought of creating a game where the player has to destroy all the
												evil imps by placing explosive mushrooms in a way that they would create a chain reaction when exploding, to deal maximum
												damage. Mushroom Mayhem has 6 levels where the players can only unlock a new level by beating the current level. 
												Since this was a one week jam and all of our team members were from a programming background, we had a tough time creating 
												Art and UI, but we were able to manage it. This game jam project helped me alot in learning and implementing new game Programming
												concepts that I haven't had the chance to work on before.

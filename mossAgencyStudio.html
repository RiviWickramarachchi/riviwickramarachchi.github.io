												Moss Agency is an indie game studio whose main focus is on creating immersive and nature-inspired gaming experiences.
												Their current project, Silvestria, is a cozy exploration and management game where players help restore a forest as
												a squirrel named Silvester, who gets swept away into an unfamiliar environment during a storm. With an emphasis on
												relaxation and discovery, the game features tasks such as planting trees, finding artifacts, and reviving the forest
												ecosystem. Moss Agency is dedicated to delivering engaging and thoughtful indie games that celebrate nature
												and foster a sense of connection to the environment.

												While I was working as a gameplay programmer at Moss Agency Studio, I implemented core gameplay mechanics using C# and Unity,
												including player movement and interaction systems. I developed key features such as a Quest System and an Inventory
												Management System utilizing Unity's scriptable objects, which streamlined in-game tasks and item management.
												I also implemented the game's Dialogue System using the Ink plugin, enhancing narrative elements and player engagement.
												Additionally, I optimized game builds to improve performance and user experience.My contributions included adding planting 
												mechanics, enabling players to plant seeds from their inventory, and creating a growth cycle system for the plants
												based on the Finite State Machine model. Furthermore to ensure smooth collaboration and project management,
												Git was used for version control, maintaining organized code repositories.

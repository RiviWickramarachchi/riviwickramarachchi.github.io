												Blackdrop Interactive is a small indie game development studio which is located in
												Karlskrona, a small city situated in the south of Sweden. The studio mainly focuses on
												engineering related problems in game development. So far, Blackdrop Interactive has worked
												with Wolfire games to produce and ship commercially successful titles such as Overgrowth, Receiver and Receiver 2.

												During my time as an intern at Blackdrop Interactive, I worked on an unannounced game project developed using Unity.
												My duties during my stay were mainly developing various in-game features as well as debugging features that could be used in game,
												Level design and asset creation. Even though I was developer, I was given the task of creating basic 3D models and assets which was 
												a new skill that I got to learn during my stay. Furthermore, I was able to learn various techniques and good coding practices
												that are necessarily needed for Game Developers which will be useful for my career.
